## Ambient Focus

Ambient Focus is a NextJS web app that allows users to layer ambient sounds to create soundscapes that transform their atmosphere in a positive way.

There were many challenges in creating this app, as I had never incorporated audio into a web app before. I found the use-sound react hook was a relatively easy way to allow users to play, pause, stop, and adjust volume of the sounds on the app. Another major challenge is the long loading time and I am currently attempting to find ways to reduce the time it takes to load the sound player. 

Overall this project was great for gaining experience in state management, using react hooks, passing props between components and pages, and learning more about Next.

The site should be live with Vercel at https://ambient-focus-chi.vercel.app/, but can also be cloned and run locally using:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
